Introduction 

A friend of mine is working for a company that has a company-sponsored study program, where its employees can obtain an MBA degree. 
My friend recently applied for the program and received an approval from the company. 
Now he is searching for a business school to apply for, and asked me for advice.

The company’s policy only requires that the business school for the program should be chosen from the top 50 business schools in the US, 
and my friend told me that he is indifferent among the top 50 schools because all of them are great schools and that he would like to decide based on what is available around the campus of each business school/university. 

Therefore, in this project, I will compare the top 50 business schools in the US based on information about the neighborhood of each campus by using the cluster analysis. 

The result will be used to guide my friend’s decision on which school(s) to apply for.
